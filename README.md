# cgau-client-adaptation
This is the official code for reproducing experiments from the paper [Client Adaptation improves Federated Learning with Simulated Non-IID Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04806) (International Workshop on Federated Learning for User Privacy and Data Confidentiality in Conjunction with ICML 2020 pdf). 

*Note: this repo is actively maintained. For any questions please file an issue.*

## documentation
We used [Weights&Biases](https://www.wandb.com/) to run and document the experiments. 

All the code to rerun our experiments lies in the [src](src) folder, divided up into [CIFAR10](src/cifar10) and [cough detection](TODO).
